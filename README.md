# Bank-Angular

This simulates basic ATM interactions. You can log in with your card and pin number. Choose to deposit or withdraw money from either your savings or chequeings account.
You can also view the past 20 transactions you've made. I also added a sign up page for users to make an account.

# To run this program:
1. cd bank-angular
2. npm install
3. npm install -g @angular/cli
4. open 2 terminals and run `npm run server` and `ng serve` on them.

## JSON server

Run npm run server to run a JSON server on http://localhost:5000.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
